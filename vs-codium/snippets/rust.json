	// Place your snippets for rust here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Format output": {
		"prefix": "f",
		"body": "format!(\"$2:{}\", $1);",
		"description": "Format output"
	},
	"Print output to console": {
		"prefix": "p",
		"body": "println!(\"$2:{}\", $1);",
		"description": "Print output to console"
	}
